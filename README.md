## Building Yourself!
In Order To Build It Yourself You Need To
   1. Open a text editor like Notepad.
   2. Download the .txt file into your desired location (Like Desktop).
   3. Rename the file to be with a '.bat' extension instead of '.txt'. :+1:

## Stuff You Expect To See In Script
Explanation:

   - Input Prompt: The script asks for the number of seconds until the shutdown.
   - Time Calculation: It calculates hours, minutes, and seconds from the entered time.
   - Countdown Display: It displays the remaining time in a loop, updating every second.
   - Shutdown Command: When the timer reaches zero, the script executes the shutdown command.

## How To Use!
Running the Script:

   1. Download the  .bat file from releases then place it into your desired location (Like Desktop).
   2. Run The Bat File.
   3. Enter the desired number of seconds when prompted.
   4. The command prompt window will display the countdown. You can press Ctrl+C at any time to cancel the shutdown. :+1:

This script provides a simple and effective way to shut down your PC after a specified time, while keeping you informed of the remaining time.
